### Event Review:
Coming off the heels of Hurricane Helene (loss of power/water/internet), I had totally forgotten the Huntress CTF was coming up. I was invited by my good friend [@JordanLinden](https://github.com/JordanLinden) to join his team of extremely talented folks. With a wide range of challs from easy & beginner friendly to incredibly hard, it really has something for everyone.
